# 🚀 OFFSTAR AI Development Platform

> **AI-Powered Development Platform** integrating Codespaces, Replit AI, Io.net, and OBL.dev for intelligent prototyping, building, and deployment.

## 🌟 Platform Overview

The OFFSTAR AI Development Platform is a revolutionary development environment that combines the power of:
- **GitHub Codespaces** for cloud development
- **Replit AI** for intelligent code generation
- **Io.net** for distributed AI processing
- **OBL.dev** for strategic planning and analytics
- **OFFSTAR Enterprise** for quantum-enhanced development

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
```bash
# Open in Codespaces
# Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh codespace create --repo protechtimenow/offstar-ai-dev-platform
```

### 2. Replit Integration
```bash
# Import to Replit
# Visit: https://replit.com/github/protechtimenow/offstar-ai-dev-platform

# Or clone in Replit terminal
git clone https://github.com/protechtimenow/offstar-ai-dev-platform.git
```

### 3. Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/protechtimenow/offstar-ai-dev-platform.git
cd offstar-ai-dev-platform
npm run setup
```
